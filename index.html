    <!-- what is javascript
     --- javascript is a high-level , programming primarily known for its role in web devlopment. it enables interactive and dynamic content on websites and is widely used to enhance user experience by adding interactivity, responsiveness, and dynamic behavior to web pages. 

     javascript display : -

     write js 1) innerHTML
              2) document.write()
              3) window.alert
              4) console.log

    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

    1) innerHTML
    To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
    the id attribute defines the HTMl element. the innerHTML property defines the HTML content.

    2) document.write
    For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write():
    Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:
    The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
    
    3) window.alert 
    You can use an alert box to display data:
    In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:

    4) console.log
    For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.
    JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
    The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.
    
    js stateement

    JavaScript statements are composed of:
    Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

    document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "hello good morning"

    semicolon : 
    Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
    Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

    let a,b,c;
    a=5;

    JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
    The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
    One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

    function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
    }

    js keyword

    JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
    js keyword : - var , let , const , if , switch, for , function , return , try.

    js value 

    Fixed values : - Fixed values are called Literals.
    Variable values : - Variable values are called Variables.

    1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
    2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

    js variable : -

    variables are used to store data values.
    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

    comments : -

    Single line comments start with //.
    Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
    
    Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
    Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

    js variable

    Variables are Containers for Storing Data
    JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
    Automatically
    Using var
    Using let
    Using const

    var : -
    The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
    The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
    These are constant values and cannot be changed.
    use global scop

    let : - 
    use block scop 
    change value but not reassign.
    The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
    The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

    const : -
    use block scop
    not change value and not reassign.

    var name declare : -
    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter.
    Names can also begin with $ and _ .
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

    JavaScript Operators : -

    operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. Operands can be values or variables, and an operator typically takes one or more operands and produces a result. JavaScript supports a variety of operators for different purposes, such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more.

    type of operator : -
    1) Arithmetic Operators
    2) Assignment Operators
    3) Comparison Operators
    4) String Operators
    5) Logical Operators 
    6) Bitwise Operators
    7) Ternary Operators
    8) Type Operators

    1) Arithmetic operators: -

    Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).
    The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
    The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

    + =  Addition
    - =  Subtraction
    * =  Multiplication
    ** = Exponentiation 
    / = Division
    % = Modulus
    ++ = Increment
    -- = Decrement

    2) Assignement operators : -

    The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
    The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.
    The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.
    The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.
    The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.
    The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand.
    The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.

    = , += , -= , *= , /= , %= , **= 

    Shift Assignment Operators : - 

    <<= , >>=  , >>>=

    Bitwise Assignment Operators : -

    &= , ^= , |=

    Logical Assignment Operators : -

    &&= , ||= , ??=

    3)JavaScript Comparison Operators : -

    == - equal to
    === - equal value and equal type
    != - not equal
    !== - not equal value or not equal type
    > - greater than
    < - less than
    >=  greater than or equal to
    <=  less than or equal to
    ?   ternary operator

    4) JavaScript Logical Operators : - 

    && = logical and
    || = logical or
    ! =  logical not

    5) typeof : -
    Returns the type of a variable.
    
    6) instanceof : -
    
    	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

    7) JavaScript Bitwise Operators : -

    & = AND
    | = OR
    ~ = NOT
    ^ = XOR
    << = left shift
    >> = right shift
    >>> = unsigned right shift

    data type : -

    data type refers to the type of value a variable.
    JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

    1) String
    2) Symbol 
    3) Null
    4) Number
    5) BigInt
    6) boolean
    7) undefind
    8) object

    1) An object
    2) An array
    3) A date

    // datatype
    
    // let a = 10;
    // let c = null;
    // let b = "viral";
    // let d = Symbol("Good morning");
    // let e = true;
    // let f = BigInt("567");
    // let g = undefined
    // console.log(a,c,b,d,e,f,g)
    
    // object
    
    // const name = {firstname:"viral" , lastname : "gediya"}
    // const cars = ["volvo" , "swift" , "BMW"]
    // console.log(name[1]);
    
    // js function
    
    // With functions you can reuse code
    // You can write code that can be used many times.
    // You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.

    js events

    onchange : - An HTML element has been changed
    onclick : - The user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover : - The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    onmouseout : - The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    onkeydown  : - The user pushes a keyboard key 
    onload : - The browser has finished loading the page

    js string

    Templete strings : -

    let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`

    string length : -

    To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:


    Escape Characters : -

    Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

    \'  = '  signle quote
    \" = "   Double quote
    \\ = \   backslash
    \b =     Backspace  
    \f =     Form Feed
    \n =     New Line
    \r =     Carriage Return
    \t =     Horizontal Tabulator
    \v =     Vertical Tabulator

   String Methods : -
   
   1) length : - The length property returns the length of a string:
   2) toUpperCase() : - A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase():
   3) toUpperCase() : - A string is converted to lower case with toLowerCase():
   3) concat() : - concat() joins two or more strings:
   4) string charAt() : The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:
   5) String charCodeAt() : - The charCodeAt() method returns the code of the character at a specified index in a string:
   6) slice() : - slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
                  The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included).
   7) substring() : - substring() is similar to slice().
                      The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring().
   8) substr()    :- substr() is similar to slice().
                      The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.
   9) trim() : - The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:
   10) trimStart() : - The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.
   11) trimEnd() : - The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.
   12) padStart() : - The padStart() method pads a string from the start.
   13) padEnd() : - The padEnd() method pads a string from the end.
   14) repeat() : - The repeat() method returns a string with a number of copies of a string.
                    The repeat() method returns a new string.
                    The repeat() method does not change the original string.
    15) replace() : - The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
    16) replaceAll() : - The replaceAll() method allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a string to be replaced.
    17) split() : - A string can be converted to an array with the split() method:

-->
    <p id="demo">hello</p>
    <!-- onclick event -->
    <!-- <button id="demobtn" onclick="myFunction()">click here</button> -->

    <!-- onmouseover -->
    <!-- <button onmouseover="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML='hey'">click here</button> -->

    <!-- onmouseout -->
    <!-- <button onmouseout="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML='hey'">click here</button> -->

    <!-- onkeydown -->
    <!-- <button onkeydown="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML='hey'">click here</button> -->

    <button onload="loadFunction()">click here</button>
